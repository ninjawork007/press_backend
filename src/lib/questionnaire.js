At Waverly, our goal is to write amazing press, tailored to you. Our writers use the following questionnaire as the primary source of inspiration. Please complete it as fully and accurately as possible highlighting any stories or upcoming items, campaigns, or events you may wish to feature. Essentially, the more we have to work with, the more in depth these articles will be.

2. Do you have a preferred title (producer, rapper, influencer, etc.) that you'd like us to use? 

3. Why should people read about you? What story do you have to tell? What makes you stand out? 

4. What are some notable career highlights? (Awards, recognition, accomplishments, etc.) 

5. What were the biggest challenges you've faced and how did you overcome them? 

6. What wisdom would you want to share with others? What lessons can people learn from you? 

7. Where do you see yourself/ your brand in a few years? What are some of your dreams and aspirations? 

8. What angle or focus for these articles that you would like to see? 

9. Provide 2 to 3 potential title ideas if you'd like.
